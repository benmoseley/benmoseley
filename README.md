### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Oxford and I research the intersection of physics and machine learning. Check out my [website / blog](https://benmoseley.blog/) and [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benmoseley/) for more. I am also a ML lead for NASA's [Frontier Development Lab](https://frontierdevelopmentlab.org/).

I'm looking to collaborate on any projects involving physics-informed machine learning. Check out my [FBPINNs](https://github.com/benmoseley/FBPINNs) repository for our lastest work on scalable physics-informed machine learning.
