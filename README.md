### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Lecturer in AI at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) in the [Department of Earth Science and Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/earth-science/) and lead the Scalable Scientific Machine Learning Lab. Before this I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [ETH ZÃ¼rich AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch/), and a ML Team Lead for NASA's [Frontier Development Lab](https://frontierdevelopmentlab.org/).

I'm open to collaboration (or supervising students) on projects involving scientific machine learning / physics-informed machine learning. Check out my [FBPINNs](https://github.com/benmoseley/FBPINNs) repository for our latest work on scalable physics-informed neural networks.

Here's a [list of repositories with materials from my AI and SciML workshops, tutorials and lectures](https://github.com/stars/benmoseley/lists/sciml-workshops-lectures).
